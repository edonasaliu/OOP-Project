# Zoo Management System & Identity Access Management System

## Overview

This repository contains two main systems: The Zoo Management System and the Identity Access Management System. Each system is designed to showcase specific object-oriented programming principles, and they are organized in separate folders for easy navigation.

## Directory Structure

- `ZooManagementSystem/`: Contains all the files related to the Zoo Management System.
  - `code.py`: The main script to run the Zoo Management System; Contains the class definitions for the Zoo Management System.
  - `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for the Zoo Management System.

- `IdentityAccessManagement/`: Contains all the files related to the Identity Access Management System.
  - `code.py`: The main script to run the Identity Access Management System; Contains the class definitions for the Identity Access Management System
  - `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for the Identity Access Management System.

## How to Run the Systems

1. Navigate to the specific system's folder that you want to run (either `ZooManagementSystem` or `IdentityAccessManagement`).
2. Read the `README.md` file in the folder to get an understanding of the system and how to run it.
3. Run the `main.py` script to see the system in action.

## Conclusion

These two systems demonstrate different aspects of object-oriented programming, with the Zoo Management System focusing on inheritance and composition in a zoo setting, and the Identity Access Management System focusing on access control in a forum-like platform. Feel free to explore the code, run the systems, and modify them as needed to better understand how they work.
